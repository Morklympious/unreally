# Pointers

I learned about C++ pointers in 2010 and I was a college student traumatized by managing them. Maybe I had a professor that sucked though. 

Since coming back to a job where I have to interface with them, C++ has actually become way better than I thought, and Unreal Engine does a great job papering over a lot of the complexities that made me fucking hate myself when I had to manage pointers or remember remotely anything about them. 


## The Unreal Pointers I Care About

At its core, I care about maybe three pointers because they're the ones I use most often:
- `TObjectPtr` for normal pointer stuff
- `TWeakObjectPtr`
- `TSoftObjectPtr`

### TObjectPtr

### TWeakObjectPtr

### TSoftObjectPtr
