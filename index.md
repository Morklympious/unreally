# Unreally?
Yes. Unreally. Partially because it has some relation to what I want to talk about here, but in other part because the domain was available. 

## Who Are You?
I'm a User Interface Engineer who has spent over a decade in the web space working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

After a small career pivot, I'm now learning to write C++ to support UI in Unreal Engine. Which means I get to go from a mature ecosystem of user interface design paradigms and technology choices straight into the desolate hellhole of Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG). 

I don't know what you hope to get by visiting this, but I hope that whatever it is, it helps you build something wonderful.
