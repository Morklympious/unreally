# Unreal Engine Types
There are a number of types that exist in Unreal Engine that I sometimes lose my mental model for, so let's enumerate them here. 


## Types I Care About
So like I said, I come from Javascript, where I cared about maybe five types:
- `Object`
- `Array`
- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`

Everything else was just another `Object`. Yes, including `Map` and `Set`. 

But in Unreal you care about primarily two types
- `UObject` (generic as hell, but useful)
- `AActor`
