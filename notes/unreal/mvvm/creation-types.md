# Viewmodel Creation Types
There are a handful of viewmodel creation types, and for the most part? They're pretty self-explanatory. In cases that you have no idea what the fuck is happning.

Here's a quick and dirty table of what each instantiation type will do for you. 

| Creation Type | General Use Case                                                 
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Manual         |Full control of creation & initialization                         |
|Create Instance|Create a guaranteed instance of a Viewmodel                       |
|Global         |Query the Viewmodel Subsystem for a globally registered viewmodel |
|Resolver       |Run custom logic to create OR locate an existing viewmodel        |
|Property Path  |Used when widget has properties/functions that point to a                                                   viewmodel                                                                          |


## Manual
Manual is the creation type you use when you want _full control_ of creating your viewmodel and providing it with whatever
stuff it needs to get going. You'll often create it manually with `NewObject` or in the Blueprint Graph with Construct Object
from Class, and then assign it to the variable that is auto-generated by the widget. 

## Create Instance
Create Instance is a creation type used when you want a "guarantee" that the viewmodel is going to exist when the widget does. 
I like this method because it defers the creation logic to that of the widget and it essentially leaves me ready to 
provide a dependency to the viewmodel in a way that makes it start working. 

In the case of something like a viewmodel that takes an Actor with an Ability System Component, I can write a function on a viewmodel
called `ProvideActor(AActor* InActor)` that will accept an actor, check to see if it has an Ability System Component, and if it does
then it'll peel that off and start subscribing to delegates on that component. Maybe it's health, maybe it's stamina, or maybe it's whether
or not the character is dead! Either way, create instance is a good one for that guarantee. 

## Global Viewmodel
The global viewmodel repository lives in a game instance subsystem. I think it's called the `MVVMViewModelGameInstanceSubsystem` (cute, I know). But basically you can upfront-register viewmodels using a "context object" that combines their class type and a unique `FName` identifier. This enables you to specify the FName when you pick this creation type and as long as you have the right FName entered in the editor, it'll resolve to your viewmodel!

I like this method, but I don't use it very often. It's good for stuff that won't change often, like the Player Controller or Local Player State, but otherwise if you're trying to shove a bunch of shit into the global repository because "I don't want to re-create and destroy viewmodels needlessly!" then you're probably optimizing prematurely. 

## Resolver
I love these things. Coming Soon. 

## Property Path
I don't know enough about these, but I'm gonna learn so I can write about 'em.
