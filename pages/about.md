# About Me
Welcome to this weird site you probably found on accident.

## Who's this clown?
Hey!

My name is Bradley. On the internet I go by Morklympious. 

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest my entire life, and I've been doing web development with javascript since about 2013.
I love the web, I love everything about it. I'm now working in Unreal Engine both personally and professionally (big career change, right?)

I'm passionate about creating experiences that users love, creating tools my coworkers can accelerate with, and above all, finding the fun
in everything I make!

In my free time, I lift weights, I stream over at [my Twitch Channel](https://mork.live), and I also participate in my local Super Smash
Brothers Melee scene here in washington!

I used to have an [old blog about my learnings with javascript](https://stffrd.github.io), and I figured why not take a crack at another blog site that might help
someone just like me, a fish out of water, learn better to swim in this ocean of the unknown.
